                    Dabakaayo madow, is a beautiful and peaceful place located in Banadir. It is known for its easy transportation and basic live facilities like mosques,hospital, schools, universities and large markets. <br>
                    The people here are warm, friendly, and deeply connected to their traditions. We celebrate many cultural islamic events, and one of my favorite islamic events is juma days and Eid festivals, which brings everyone together. <br>
