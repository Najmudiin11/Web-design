                    <h4>Somali National University</h4>
                    My university is Somali National University. <br>
                    It was stablished in 1954 in the Trust Territort of Somalia. It obtained official university status in 1969, it was closed due to the civil war, and later on re-opened in 2014, the main compus of the university is Gahayr compus, which has large scale of land and beautiful gardens. <br> 
                    It is a place where students from different backgrounds and defferent regions come together to learn, grow, and build a better future. <br> I am proud to be a student at Somali National University, i am part of the Computer Science and have had the opportunity to study under some of the most inspiring professors like Prof Abdullahi Sharif. My university offers a wide range of academic programs, advanced research facilities, and a vibrant student community.
